# Snake

This is a snake game created using the Turtle graphics library

This program does not require any outside download sources in order for this to function

The turtle library is responsible for the GUI of the game and the object responsible for increasing the size of the snake

Whenever the snake reaches the object, the snake grows in size and is a visual representation of a list that travels in a grid.
